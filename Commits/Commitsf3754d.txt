security.AltSyscall.*: drop NULL argument test

According to glibc BZ #27662 calling adjtimex/clock_adjtime with
a NULL arg is undefined behaviour and anything can happen, even
segfaults which occur with glibc 2.32 on 32bit arm systems.

I verified the sources that no other direct NULL call happens so
we can drop this test but if at runtime any software fails eg by
passing a NULL pointer variable, the call should be preceded by
a NULL check.

TEST=Local builds on kevin; CQ.
