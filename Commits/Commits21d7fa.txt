network: VPNConnect: Collect logs after shutdown VPN server

We are collecting logs from VPN server in the VPNConnect test after the
test is done. Currently we observed that the collected charon.log are
always not finished. Since we collect the log before charon process
exits, a potential reason could be charon hasn't flushed all contents
into the disk. This patch changes the order to shutting down charon at
first to avoid that happening.

BUG=b:184128838
TEST=run tests on octopus 5 times, observed a completed log in all
  attempts.
