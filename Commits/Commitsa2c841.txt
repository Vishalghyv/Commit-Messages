tast-tests: promote arc.Optin to critical

Optin has been stable for the last 20 runs. The only failures are due to infra
related problems. Also increased the retry count for the unstable version to
see if one retry is enough to get the same stability.

BUG=b:177341225
TEST=tast run DUT arc.Optin
TEST=tastboard shows test is stable except for infra issues
