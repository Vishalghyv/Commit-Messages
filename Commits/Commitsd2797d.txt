BootedDeviceReporter: Parameterize by BootMode

The attached bug occurred because we were not controlling the initial
boot mode of the DUT. With this CL, we explicitly test each boot mode in
a controlled environment. The Dev Mode test is currently disabled while
Dev Mode transition seeks stabilization.
