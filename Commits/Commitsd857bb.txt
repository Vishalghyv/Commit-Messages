tast: update hardware condition documentation

"should not depend on .. such as command execution" was confusing in
some cases because the next paragraph describes the temporary interanal
implementation in Tast which looks like contradicting with it.

The paragraph is more relevant to the Hardware dependencies (previous
section) rather than Adding new hardware conditions.
Since the Hardware dependencies section already describes similar thing
by some examples, removing the entire paragraph.

BUG=none
TEST=none
